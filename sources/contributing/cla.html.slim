h1 Grafana Contributor License Agreement

h2 Why is this agreement necessary?
p We very much appreciate your wanting to contribute to Grafana, but we need to add you to the contributors list first.

p Note that the following agreement is not a transfer of copyright ownership, this simply is a license agreement for contributions. You also do not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

p For some background on why contributor license agreements are necessary, you can read FAQs from many other open source projects:

p This is part of the legal framework of the open-source ecosystem that adds some red tape, but protects both the contributor and the company / foundation behind the project. It also gives us the option to relicense the code with a more permissive license in the future.

p If you have more questions, shoot us an email or drop by #grafana on IRC (freenode).
