 of dashboards as favorites. This is accomplished in the Save menu. Click on the save icon and then _Mark As Favorite_.

In this view you can select the dashboards you want to include in the playlist, and even remove dashboards from you favorites list. Set the time span between dashboard change, for example 1m, 10m, 1h for 1 minute, 10 minute or 1 hour interval.

To start the dashboard click the Start button.

When a dashboard playlist is running, most menu buttons and dashboard controls are hidden. This is in order to present as clear a view of the dashboard as possible for big tv displays. Click the stop playlist link in the top menu to the right to stop the playlist.
