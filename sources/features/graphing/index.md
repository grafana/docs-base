### Axes, Grid & Legend options

**Legens values**

Check ``Include Values`` under legend styles.

- Total   - Sum of all values returned from metric query
- Current - Last value returned from the metric query

This means that if your series represents a rate, for example requests / second then the Total in the legend will
not represent the total number of requests. It is just the sum of all data points.


### Display options

- Cumulative - Sum of series below plus the series you hover over
- Individual - Just the value for the series you hover over
