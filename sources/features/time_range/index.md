# Time range controls


![](docs/time_range_controls.png)

In the menu you have the time range dropdown (between to Zoom out and refresh links).
In this dropdown you have relative time options, auto refresh options and custom time options.

To customize the relative and auto refresh options open the dashboard settings and click the Timepicker tab.
In this tab you can specify the relative and auto refresh intervals. The Timepicker tab settings are saved
on per dashboard basis.
